### Work flow of using the site

1. User reaches the Home Page of Front End
2. User can read About Me's and see the log in button 
3. User can navigate to either edit or generate page via header nav bar
2. Generate page gives option to input prompt and once prompt returns image they have option to save (possibly either to DB or Google Drive)
3. Edit page gives option to view all saved prompts and select one to (possibly display the image) edit or delete it
